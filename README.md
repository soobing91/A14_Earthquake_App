This exercises utilizes Leaflet.js to plot geographic locations of earthquake events detected during the last 7 days and boundaries of tectonic plates. Sources of the data used are as follows:
* [USGS Geo JSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)
* [`fraxen/tectonicplates` Github repository](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/blob/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json)

For codes, please refer to the following documents:
* `static/js/logic.js` for main leaflet.js visualization
